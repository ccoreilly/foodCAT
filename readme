folder 'buildNET' contains several scripts, the important ones are:
                  'folder_stats.py' which allows you to summarize how many data you have
                  'builder/buildNET.py' which allows you to create the files train, val and test
                                        from your images folders.

folder 'data' contains the folders with the source images

folder 'foodCAT' contains the files train, val and test that 'buildNET/builder/buildNET.py' creates

folder 'models' contains the different models with which you can run caffe with our datasets

folder 'utils' contains docs related to the project, examples of other networks, and theory slides of IA

WARNINGS:
    1. If you use a different machine to run caffe all the paths must be set. So, You will need to generate/modify again
        1.1 folder 'foodCAT' by using the script 'buildNET/builder/buildNET.py' running it from the folder '/buildNET/builder/'
            in other to generate the train, val and test txt with the current absolute path
        1.2 'models/model_to_use/train_val.prototxt', modify absolutes path of:
            1.2.1 In layers 'data' in param 'image_data_param'
                modify the parameter 'source' to point to your 'foodCAT/<train or val>.txt'
        1.3 In 'models/model_to_use/solver.prototxt', modify absolutes path of:
            1.3.1 parameter 'net' to point to your 'models/model_to_use/train_val.prototxt'
            1.3.2 parameter 'snapshot_prefix' to point to your folder 'models/model_to_use/snapshots'
