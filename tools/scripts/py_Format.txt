This file explain the mode how we code in Python Language.


1.	We comment what every function does between """ comment tool after the function definition as Python Enhancement 		Proposals (PEP) does.
2.	We use 3 break Lines (bl, in future) to separate functions.
3.	Inside functions, we comment what every line does with # comment tool (before the line), excepts when the code is 	 	really auto-explained.
4.	For readability, we let a space in both sides in parameters i.e. ( parameter_with_left_and_right_space )
